# EE5114 Autonomous Robot Navigation Assignment

This Autonomous Robot Navigation course has several continuous assignments from the **implementation of EKF (Extended Kalman Filter)** to estimate drone position and velocity based on GPS data. The second assignment is **applying the Fast SLAM 1.0 Algorithm** to predict the robot's motion and position (Localize the robot in the environment). The third assignment is the **implementation of the A star global path planner algorithm** to generate a global path from start to goal position. The fourth assignment is the **implementation of an MPC (Model Predictive Controller)** to control and track the desired or reference position of the drone.
